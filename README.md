# hashER
non-optimal scenarios benchmarking of sc(n/multiome)RNA-seq hashing demultiplex tools

# Goal
Your new hashing data has just been rushed to the emergency room. Visually, it's clearly not doing well -- the data is messy, maybe not even bimodal! So can it be rescued? Which tool(s), often designed and optimized for idealized situations, should be called upon?
